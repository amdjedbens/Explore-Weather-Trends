### Submission - PDF that includes:
  * An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:
    Tools used for each step (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)
  * How did you calculate the moving average?
  * What were your key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
  * Line chart with local and global temperature trends
  * At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends


### Project Specification:
